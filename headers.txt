Content-Type specifies the media type that the response is sending. In this case, it's json using charset UTF-8. 

Vary describes what request headers can be matched when deciding if a cached response can be used. 

The Content-Encoding describes the encoding of the media, which in this case is gzip which matches one of our Accept-Encoding options in the request header. 

Date is the date. 

Server just describes the type of server the response is being sent from. 

Cache-control describes caching mechanisms for responses. Private means it can only be cached by a browser's cache. 

X-XSS-Protection can provide cross-site scripting filters. 

X-Frame-Options specifies in what ways a browser should render a page. SAMEORIGIN means that the page should only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page. 

X-Content-Type-Options disables MIME sniffing. The browser then uses the type in Content-Type. 

Alt-Svc is a list of ways to reach this same service. 

Transfer-Encoding is the type of encoding used to send this data to the client. Chunked means the data is sent in multiple chunks.
